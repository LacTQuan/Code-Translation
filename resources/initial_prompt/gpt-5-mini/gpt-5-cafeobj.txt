Task:
Translate the given code from Python to CafeObj.

Action:
- Translate only syntax and language-specific constructs so the program compiles/runs in the target language.
- Preserve all identifiers (variable, function, class, constant) and comments verbatim unless they must be minimally modified for syntactic validity in the target language (e.g., reserved-word conflict â€” append a single underscore).
- Do not change or correct the program logic, algorithms, or behavior even if they are incorrect or buggy. Do not infer the intended problem or add missing logic.
- Make only the minimal, direct syntactic changes required by the target language (types, imports/includes, punctuation, control-structure syntax, etc.). Do not refactor, optimize, or reorganize code.
- If a source-language construct has no exact equivalent, implement the closest literal construct that reproduces the same written steps.
- If multiple files are needed, place them one after another separated by a single line containing exactly: ===FILE_BREAK===
- Output constraints: return only the translated code in CafeObj. Do not include explanations, commentary, analysis, or code fences. Do not output filenames or extra metadata.

Goal:
Produce a faithful, token-efficient translation of the provided Python code into CafeObj, preserving identifiers and comments and making only the minimal syntactic changes needed for valid target-language code
